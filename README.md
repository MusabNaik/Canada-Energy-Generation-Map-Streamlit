# Interactive Map of Canadian Electricity Generation

![Interactive Map Preview](screenshot.png)

## Overview

This project aims to create an interactive map visualizing the sources of electricity generation in each province of Canada. The map is built using the Streamlit framework for creating web applications and the Plotly library for interactive visualizations. Users can select different years, provinces, and other filtering options to dynamically update the map and explore the data.

## Features

- Interactive map of Canada showcasing electricity generation sources in each province.
- Dropdown menus and interactive widgets for year selection, province filtering, and more.
- Real-time updates to the map based on user selections.
- Plotly's choropleth maps to display data variations across provinces.
- Utilizes Streamlit's simplicity for creating web applications with Python.
- Easily customizable to incorporate additional features or data sources.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Plotly
